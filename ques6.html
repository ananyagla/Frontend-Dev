    <p>My hobbies include <strong>painting and singing</strong>,which allow me to express my creativity and emotions in unique ways.Painting helps me <em>relax and connect with my imagination</em>,as I enjoy experimenting with colors, ideas, and different styles of art. Singing, on the other hand, brings me joy and confidence—<em>it’s a wonderful way to express feelings and connect with others through music</em></p>
    <p>Painting and singing are my favorite hobbies because they help me relax and express my inner thoughts creatively. <br> Through colors and melodies, I find a beautiful way to share emotions and bring positivity into my life.</p>
