            <h2>The Art of Typography in Web Design</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                Typography is more than just choosing a font — it’s about creating a
                <strong>visual rhythm</strong> and <em>harmony</em> that guides readers
                through content effortlessly. Good typography improves readability, evokes emotion,
                and enhances the overall experience of a website.
            </p>

            <p>
                Web designers often combine multiple <mark>font families</mark> to establish hierarchy
                — for instance, using a bold sans-serif for headings and a lighter serif for body text.
                Proper use of <strong>font-weight</strong> and <em>font-size</em> can help
                differentiate important information from general content.
            </p>

            <p>
                Adjusting <mark>line-height</mark> and <mark>letter-spacing</mark> makes long paragraphs
                more pleasant to read. Centered, left, or justified alignment can completely change the
                tone of an article. Designers also use subtle <em>color contrasts</em> to draw attention
                without overwhelming readers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, CSS pseudo-elements like <strong>::first-letter</strong> and
                <strong>::first-line</strong> allow for creative emphasis — similar to how
                printed books start paragraphs with decorative initials.
